 ## 🧠 Project Objective

This project aims to analyze Tesla Inc.'s stock performance over a 12-year period. By combining structured SQL querying with interactive Power BI dashboards, we identify historical trends, significant volume spikes, and year-over-year (YoY) price performance. The project demonstrates key data analytics competencies, including:
* Data wrangling and transformation
* Time-series aggregation and rolling averages
* Advanced DAX calculations
* Interactive business dashboards

## 📁 Project Structure
- [SQL](SQL) # SQL scripts for grouping, moving averages, trends
- [PowerBI](POWERBI) # .pbix file containing the interactive dashboard
- [Visuals](Visuals) # Dashboard screenshot
- [Data](Data)  #  Source Data


## 📌 Tools & Technologies

* Data Source : Tesla stock price CSV (2010–2021) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhimaneukj/tesla-inc-tsla-dataset)
* Query Language : Microsoft SQL Server
* Visualization : Power BI
* Version Control : Git + GitHub

## 🔍 Key SQL Analysis Steps

* Imported raw Tesla stock CSV into SQL Server
* Converted string dates to SQL DATE format
* Grouped and aggregated:
	- **Monthly averages**
	- **Year-over-year price trends**
	- **Rolling 30-day volume averages**
* Detected **volume spikes** using deviation thresholds from moving averages

Sample SQL query to compute monthly average:
```
SELECT 
    FORMAT(CAST([Date] AS DATE), 'yyyy-MM') AS [Month],
    ROUND(AVG([Open]), 2) AS Avg_Open,
    ROUND(AVG([High]), 2) AS Avg_High,
    ROUND(AVG([Low]), 2) AS Avg_Low,
    ROUND(AVG([Close]), 2) AS Avg_Close,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST([Volume] AS bigint)), 0) AS Avg_Volume
FROM 
    TSLA
GROUP BY 
    FORMAT(CAST([Date] AS DATE), 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY 
    [Month];
```

 ## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

 Built in Power BI, the dashboard contains:

 ### 📌 KPI Cards
 * **Average Closing Price (YTD)**
 * **Volume Spike Count**
 * **YoY % Change in Closing Price**
 * **Maximum Daily Volume**

 	### 📊 Visuals
* **YoY Change Bar Chart**: Highlights yearly stock performance
* **Monthly Avg Close Trend**: Long-term monthly price analysis
* **Top Volume Spikes Table**: Days with highest spike %
* **Price vs Volume Trend**: Dual-axis visualization for correlation insights

 	### 🧠 DAX Measures
  * Custom Year-over-Year % Change
  * 30-day Moving Averages
  * Volume Spike Percentages
  * Conditional logic for spike flagging

 ## 📌 Business Insights
 
 * **Massive growth** observed between 2019–2021, with YoY price increases exceeding **300%**
 * **Volume spikes** often align with major product announcements or market reactions
 * **Monthly averages** reveal seasonal and trend-based investor behavior

 ## 🧳 Skills Demonstrated

 * Relational data querying and time-based aggregation (SQL)
 * Advanced Power BI modeling and DAX
 * KPI and trend-focused dashboard design
 * Business storytelling using real-world financial data

 ## 🧱 How to Reproduce

1. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/Dannyjohn03/Tesla-Stock-Analysis-2010-2021-.git)
2. Import the CSV dataset into SQL Server or use Power BI’s data view
3. Run SQL scripts to explore or transform data
4. Open Tesla_Stock_Analysis.pbix in Power BI Desktop
5. Use the slicers (e.g., Year) to interact with the dashboard

 ## 📌 Future Improvements

 * Integrate live API to fetch current Tesla stock data
 * Add forecasting visuals using ARIMA/Prophet or Power BI’s native tools
 * Automate daily refresh with Power BI Service
